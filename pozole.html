                    Remove and discard the stems, seeds, and large veins from the chili pods. Heat a cast iron pan on
                    medium high and heat the chili pods for a couple minutes, until they begin to soften. Do not let
                    them burn.<br>
                    While the chilies are heating, bring a medium pot with 3 cups of water to a simmer and remove from
                    heat. Once the chiles have softened, add the chiles to the pot hot water and cover.

                    Heat a tablespoon or two of olive oil (enough to coat the bottom of the pan) in a large sauté pan on
                    medium high heat. Pat the pork pieces dry with paper towels. Sprinkle them generously with salt.

                    Working in batches, taking care not to crowd the pan or stir the meat much, brown the meat on all
                    sides.
                    Right at the end of browning the meat, add 4 cloves of roughly chopped garlic to the pan with the
                    meat, let cook with the meat for about a minute.

                    Once the meat has browned, transfer it to the large stockpot of boiling water. Scrape up any browned
                    bits at the bottom of the pan, and any garlic, and add those to the pot as well. Add the rinsed
                    hominy.

                    Add bay leaves, cumin, and oregano. When you put the oregano in, smoosh together with your hands so
                    that the oregano breaks up more as it goes in. Add a tablespoons of salt. Bring to a simmer, reduce
                    the heat and cook for 15 minutes.

                    <div class="fw-bold">Prepare the red sauce:</div>
                    by puréeing in a blender the chilies, 2 1/2 cups or so of their soaking liquid, a teaspoon of salt,
                    and 4 cloves of garlic. (To prevent the blender from creating too much pressure, it's probably best
                    to start with the chiles and garlic and only a cup of the liquid in the blender, and then adding the
                    rest of the liquid.)

                    Strain the red sauce through a sieve, discarding the tough bits of the sauce.

                    Add another couple teaspoons of salt. Return to a simmer, lower the heat to just high enough to
                    maintain a simmer, partially covered.

                    Skim away excess fat. Taste for seasoning and add more salt to taste (you will likely need more than
                    you expect, perhaps a tablespoon or more.)

                    The resulting soup should be rather brothy, as you will be adding a lot garnishes. Add more water if
                    necessary.

                    When getting ready to serve the pozole, you can prep the garnishes (slice the cabbage, chop the
                    cilantro, etc.)

                    To serve, arrange the garnishes in bowls on the table and serve the pozole soup into bowls. Let your
                    guests pick and choose which garnishes they would like on their pozole.

                    Serve with tostada shells (or tortilla chips if you can't find tostada shells).
